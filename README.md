# make-table-in-python
It is the easiest method to make math table in python


You can extend table by changing the range in the code . e.g;
if the range is range(1,11) , then it will execute table till 10.
if you want to extend the table till 𝘠𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘕𝘶𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳 then u can simply change the range like that. e.g;
range(1,𝘠𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘕𝘶𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳)

if u want me to make the range option as an input then let me know .. :)
